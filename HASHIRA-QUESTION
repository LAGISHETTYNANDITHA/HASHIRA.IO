You are given a **JSON file** that contains:

* **n**: the degree of the polynomial equation.
* **k**: the number of points (roots/coordinates) provided.
* **k coordinate pairs** of the form (x_i, y_i), where the y-values are to be computed using given basis (Bayesian?) values $y_1$.

The relationship is:

$$
k = m + 1
$$

where $m$ is the degree of the polynomial.

### Task:

Write code (**not in Python**) that:

1. Reads the inputs from the JSON file.
2. Uses the given $k$ points $(x_i, y_i)$ to compute the coefficients of the polynomial of degree $n$.
3. Determines the constant term $c$ of the polynomial.
